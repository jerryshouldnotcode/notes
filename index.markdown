I’m Jeremiah, and here’s my public notebook.

I write here mainly to comprehend conceptual and technical ideas better. Documenting my thinking, so lots of notes, sketches, and artifacts from ideas I’ve found interesting enough to explore.

Fields range from math to software, data, and general thoughts on human-made systems.
